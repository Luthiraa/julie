Julie is a lightweight, transparent desktop AI assistant built to reduce context switching.
It lives on top of your workspace, understands what's on your screen, and responds via voice or text without forcing you to switch tabs, copy context, or break focus.

Julie is also **agentic** — it can autonomously control your browser, execute terminal commands, and interact with your computer using mouse and keyboard actions.

Built in a weekend to see if it was possible, and open-sourced for anyone who wants to explore or extend it.
